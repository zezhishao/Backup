The comparison between different trajectory similarity measure method using maritime data



TODO List:

1. Prepare trajectory data of maritime. √
2. Preprocess for maritime trajectory. √
3. Visualization √
4.  **Figure out how to use these trajectories**
5. Implement all algorithm(or model) 
6. Comparison of different methods 
7. Develop some methods to make algorithms better



**Kalman filter** is needed in step 2, for eliminate the effect of noise and low sampling rate.



Methods include:

- DTW
- EDR
- LCSS
- CATS
- BDS
- Deep representation
